## User Story
As a burger lover, I would to create my own burgers, and be able to devour them virtualy.

## Version 1.0
* This app runs via heroku or by entering the command "node server.js."
* Make sure you are in the main folder when running the code on the command line.
* This app allows the user to add as many burgers as they want to a list on the left hand side of screen.  If they so choose they can devour those burgers, which moves them to the right hand side of the screen.
